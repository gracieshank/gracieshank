# Grace's Page
<h1>Armadillos and the Great Wall</h1>
<p1>Many animals are affected by the border wall. Included among them
is the Armadillo.</p1>

<p2>The wall limits their ability to find food, water, and mates.</p2>

<p3>A wall of just twelve inches can put a halt to their journey.</p3>

<p4>Please consider sharing this page on social media so that
we can do our best to bring this to the attention of our 
government and make larger passage points for animals who need
to cross the border.</p4>

_Italics are pretty rad_
